This project made by me, is just a template that I made using others template. I just wanted the plain code to finally integrate react in my electron project plus vite.

The objective of this simple template is the integration of multiple frameworks that can help the development of sloppy desktop apps.

Thanks to another template I found, I finally made it in JavaScript.
