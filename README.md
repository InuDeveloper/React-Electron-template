# Test template - InuDeveloper

This project made by me, is just a template that I made using others template. I just wanted the plain code to finally integrate react in my electron project plus vite.

The objective of this simple template is the integration of multiple frameworks that can help the development of sloppy desktop apps.

Thanks to another template I found, I finally made it in JavaScript.

## Why?

This application is used to test, research and create integrations with Electron.js.

I wanted to integrate React.js for a project, and here I am now testing CSS frameworks and UI libraries to integrate with React.

## Progress

I integrated React to the project already and tested Radix UI. Now I'm going to try Panda UI and Kuma UI. If none of them satisfy my product, I will try Tailwind CSS.

## I will keep this markdown notes updated
