# Test template - InuDeveloper

## Why?

This application is used to test, research and create integrations with Electron.js.

I wanted to integrate React.js for a project, and here I am now testing CSS frameworks and UI libraries to integrate with React.

## Progress

I integrated React to the project already and tested Radix UI. Now I'm going to try Panda UI and Kuma UI. If none of them satisfy my product, I will try Tailwind CSS.

I will keep this markdown notes updated
